    Fixed issue in MySQL dialect where using INSERT..FROM SELECT in combination
    with ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE would erroneously render on MySQL 8 and above
    the "AS new" clause, leading to syntax failures.  This clause is required
    on MySQL 8 to follow the VALUES clause if use of the "new" alias is
    present, however is not permitted to follow a FROM SELECT clause.
