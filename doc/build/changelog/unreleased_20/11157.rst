    Fixed issue in :ref:`engine_insertmanyvalues` feature where using a primary
    key column with an "inline execute" default generator such as an explicit
    :class:`.Sequence` with an explcit schema name, while at the same time
    using the
    :paramref:`_engine.Connection.execution_options.schema_translate_map`
    feature would fail to render the sequence or the parameters properly,
    leading to errors.
