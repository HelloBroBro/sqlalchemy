    Fixed issue where a :class:`.MetaData` collection would not be
    serializable, if an :class:`.Enum` or :class:`.Boolean` datatype were
    present which had been adapted. This specific scenario in turn could occur
    when using the :class:`.Enum` or :class:`.Boolean` within ORM Annotated
    Declarative form where type objects frequently get copied.
