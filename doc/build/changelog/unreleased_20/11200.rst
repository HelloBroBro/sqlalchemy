    Fixed typing regression caused by PR :ticket:`11055` in version 2.0.29 that
    attempted to add ``ParamSpec`` to the asyncio ``run_sync()`` methods, where
    using :meth:`_asyncio.AsyncConnection.run_sync` with
    :meth:`_schema.MetaData.reflect` would fail on mypy due to a bug.
    See https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/17093 for details.
