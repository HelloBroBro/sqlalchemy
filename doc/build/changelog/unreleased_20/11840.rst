    The changes made for SQLite CHECK constraint reflection in versions 2.0.33
    and 2.0.34 , :ticket:`11832` and :ticket:`11677`, have now been fully
    reverted, as users continued to identify existing use cases that stopped
    working after this change.   For the moment, because SQLite does not
    provide any consistent way of delivering information about CHECK
    constraints, SQLAlchemy is limited in what CHECK constraint syntaxes can be
    reflected, including that a CHECK constraint must be stated all on a
    single, independent line (or inline on a column definition)  without
    newlines, tabs in the constraint definition or unusual characters in the
    constraint name.  Overall, reflection for SQLite is tailored towards being
    able to reflect CREATE TABLE statements that were originally created by
    SQLAlchemy DDL constructs.  Long term work on a DDL parser that does not
    rely upon regular expressions may eventually improve upon this situation.
    A wide range of additional cross-dialect CHECK constraint reflection tests
    have been added as it was also a bug that these changes did not trip any
    existing tests.
