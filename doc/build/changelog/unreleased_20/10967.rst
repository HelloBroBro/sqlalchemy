    Fixed issue where using :meth:`_orm.Session.delete` along with the
    :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.version_id_col` feature would fail to use the
    correct version identifier in the case that an additional UPDATE were
    emitted against the target object as a result of the use of
    :paramref:`_orm.relationship.post_update` on the object.  The issue is
    similar to :ticket:`10800` just fixed in version 2.0.25 for the case of
    updates alone.
