    Fixed regression from 1.4 where using :func:`_orm.defaultload` in
    conjunction with a non-propagating loader like :func:`_orm.contains_eager`
    would nonetheless propagate the :func:`_orm.contains_eager` to a lazy load
    operation, causing incorrect queries as this option is only intended to
    come from an original load.
