    Fixed issue where using loader options such as :func:`_orm.selectinload`
    with additional criteria in combination with ORM DML such as
    :func:`_sql.insert` with RETURNING would not correctly set up internal
    contexts required for caching to work correctly, leading to incorrect
    results.
