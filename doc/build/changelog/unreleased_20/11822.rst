    Added error "The server failed to resume the transaction" to the list of
    error strings for the pymssql driver in determining a disconnect scenario,
    as observed by one user using pymssql under otherwise unknown conditions as
    leaving an unusable connection in the connection pool which fails to ping
    cleanly.
