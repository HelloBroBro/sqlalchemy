    Fixed issue in :func:`_orm.selectin_polymorhpic` loader option where the
    SELECT emitted would only accommodate for the child-most class among the
    result rows that were returned, leading intermediary-class attributes to be
    unloaded if there were no concrete instances of that intermediary-class
    present in the result.   This issue only presented itself for multi-level
    inheritance hierarchies.
