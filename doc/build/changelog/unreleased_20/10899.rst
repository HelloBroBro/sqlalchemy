    Fixed issue where it was not possible to use a type (such as an enum)
    within a :class:`_orm.Mapped` container type if that type were declared
    locally within the class body.  The scope of locals used for the eval now
    includes that of the class body itself.  In addition, the expression within
    :class:`_orm.Mapped` may also refer to the class name itself, if used as a
    string or with future annotations mode.
