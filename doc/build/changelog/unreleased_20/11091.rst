    Fixed issue in ORM annotated declarative where using
    :func:`_orm.mapped_column()` with an :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.index`
    or :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.unique` setting of False would be
    overridden by an incoming ``Annotated`` element that featured that
    parameter set to ``True``, even though the immediate
    :func:`_orm.mapped_column()` element is more specific and should take
    precedence.  The logic to reconcile the booleans has been enhanced to
    accommodate a local value of ``False`` as still taking precedence over an
    incoming ``True`` value from the annotated element.
