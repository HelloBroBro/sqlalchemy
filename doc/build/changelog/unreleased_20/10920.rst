    Fixed regression in history_meta example where the use of
    :meth:`_schema.MetaData.to_metadata` to make a copy of the history table
    would also copy indexes (which is a good thing), but causing naming
    conflicts indexes regardless of naming scheme used for those indexes. A
    "_history" suffix is now added to these indexes in the same way as is
    achieved for the table name.
