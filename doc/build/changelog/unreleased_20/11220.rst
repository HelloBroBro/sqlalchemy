    Added new attribute :attr:`_orm.ORMExecuteState.is_from_statement`, to
    detect statements of the form ``select().from_statement()``, and also
    enhanced ``FromStatement`` to set :attr:`_orm.ORMExecuteState.is_select`,
    :attr:`_orm.ORMExecuteState.is_insert`,
    :attr:`_orm.ORMExecuteState.is_update`, and
    :attr:`_orm.ORMExecuteState.is_delete` according to the element that is
    sent to the :meth:`_sql.Select.from_statement` method itself.
