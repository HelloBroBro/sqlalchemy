    Fixed issue in mariadbconnector dialect where query string arguments that
    weren't checked integer or boolean arguments would be ignored, such as
    string arguments like ``unix_socket``, etc.  As part of this change, the
    argument parsing for particular elements such as ``client_flags``,
    ``compress``, ``local_infile`` has been made more consistent across all
    MySQL / MariaDB dialect which accept each argument. Pull request courtesy
