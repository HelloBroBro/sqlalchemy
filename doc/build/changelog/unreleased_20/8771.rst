    An error is raised if a :class:`.QueuePool` or other non-asyncio pool class
    is passed to :func:`_asyncio.create_async_engine`.  This engine only
    accepts asyncio-compatible pool classes including
    :class:`.AsyncAdaptedQueuePool`. Other pool classes such as
    :class:`.NullPool` are compatible with both synchronous and asynchronous
    engines as they do not perform any locking.
