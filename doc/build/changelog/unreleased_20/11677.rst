    Improvements to the regex used by the SQLite dialect to reflect the name
    and contents of a CHECK constraint.  Constraints with newline, tab, or
    space characters in either or both the constraint text and constraint name
    are now properly reflected.   Pull request courtesy Jeff Horemans.
