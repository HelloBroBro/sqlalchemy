    :tickets: 11176

    Fixed regression from the 1.4 series where the refactor of the
    :meth:`_types.TypeEngine.with_variant` method introduced at
    :ref:`change_6980` failed to accommodate for the ``.copy()`` method, which
    will lose the variant mappings that are set up. This becomes an issue for
    the very specific case of a "schema" type, which includes types such as
    :class:`.Enum` and :class:`.ARRAY`, when they are then used in the context
    of an ORM Declarative mapping with mixins where copying of types comes into
    play.  The variant mapping is now copied as well.
