    Fixed issue in the
    :paramref:`_engine.Connection.execution_options.logging_token` option,
    where changing the value of ``logging_token`` on a connection that has
    already logged messages would not be updated to reflect the new logging
    token.  This in particular prevented the use of
    :meth:`_orm.Session.connection` to change the option on the connection,
    since the BEGIN logging message would already have been emitted.
