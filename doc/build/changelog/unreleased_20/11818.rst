    The pin for ``setuptools<69.3`` in ``pyproject.toml`` has been
    removed.  This pin was to prevent a sudden change to :pep:`625` in
    setuptools from taking place which changes the file name of SQLAlchemy's
    source distribution on pypi to be an all lower case name, which is very
    likely to cause problems with various build environments that expected a
    particular naming style.  However, the presence of this pin is now holding
    back environments that otherwise want to use a newer setuptools, so we've
    decided to move forward with this change, with the assumption that build
    environments will have largely accommodated the setuptools change by
    now.
