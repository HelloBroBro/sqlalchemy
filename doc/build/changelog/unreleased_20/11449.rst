    Fixed very old issue involving the :paramref:`_orm.joinedload.innerjoin`
    parameter where making use of this parameter mixed into a query that also
    included joined eager loads along a self-referential or other cyclical
    relationship, along with complicating factors like inner joins added for
    secondary tables and such, would have the chance of splicing a particular
    inner join to the wrong part of the query.  Additional state has been added
    to the internal method that does this splice to make a better decision as
    to where splicing should proceed.
