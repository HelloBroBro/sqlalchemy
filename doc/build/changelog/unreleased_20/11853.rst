    An warning is emitted if :func:`_orm.joinedload` or
    :func:`_orm.subqueryload` are used as a top level option against a
    statement that is not a SELECT statement, such as with an
    ``insert().returning()``.   There are no JOINs in INSERT statements nor is
    there a "subquery" that can be repurposed for subquery eager loading, and
    for UPDATE/DELETE joinedload does not support these either, so it is never
    appropriate for this use to pass silently.
