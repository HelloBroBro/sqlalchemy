    Improvements to the regex used by the SQLite dialect to reflect the name
    and contents of a UNIQUE constraint that is defined inline within a column
    definition inside of a SQLite CREATE TABLE statement, accommodating for tab
    characters present within the column / constraint line. Pull request
