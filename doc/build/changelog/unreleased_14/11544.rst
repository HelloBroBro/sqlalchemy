    Fixed caching issue where the
    :paramref:`_sql.Select.with_for_update.key_share` element of
    :meth:`_sql.Select.with_for_update` was not considered as part of the cache
    key, leading to incorrect caching if different variations of this parameter
    were used with an otherwise identical statement.
