    Fixed regression from version 2.0.28 caused by the fix for :ticket:`11085`
    where the newer method of adjusting post-cache bound parameter values would
    interefere with the implementation for the :func:`_orm.subqueryload` loader
    option, which has some more legacy patterns in use internally, when
    the additional loader criteria feature were used with this loader option.
