    Fixed issue in cursor handling which affected handling of duplicate
    :class:`_sql.Column` or similar objcts in the columns clause of
    :func:`_sql.select`, both in combination with arbitary :func:`_sql.text()`
    clauses in the SELECT list, as well as when attempting to retrieve
    :meth:`_engine.Result.mappings` for the object, which would lead to an
    internal error.
